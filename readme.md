Rogue Forest
============

This is an entry for Cemetech Contest #24. The theme for this is
"Collaborative Safari", which requires a team consisting of exactly
two people, and to create a game that is related to exploring a wilderness.

The Game
--------
Planned: A top-down roguelike game which takes place in a forest. You are a
cherry-flavoured dragon, who wants to explore ruins in a magical forest while
searching for the legendary Cherry of Yendor.

TODO
----
At the moment, putting together how the graphics will be stored and accessed.
