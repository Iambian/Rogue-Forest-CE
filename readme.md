Rogue Forest
============

This is an entry for Cemetech Contest #24. The theme for this is
"Collaborative Safari", which requires a team consisting of exactly
two people, and to create a game that is related to exploring a wilderness.

The Game
--------
Planned: A top-down roguelike game which takes place in a forest. You are a
cherry-flavoured dragon, who wants to explore ruins in a magical forest while
searching for the legendary Cherry of Yendor.

Installing
----------
Send the following files to the calculator:
* bin/AAAAMAPS.8xp
* src/gfx/output/RoFoDAT0.8xv
* src/gfx/output/RoFoDAT1.8xv
* src/gfx/output/RoFoDAT2.8xv
* src/gfx/output/RoFoDAT3.8xv

Running
-------
Run `AAAAMAPS.8xp` on your calc as an assembly program, or use your favorite
shell (such as Cesium) to run it.

TODO
----
Stats, enemies, battles, warping, overworld map, and adding the cherry.
